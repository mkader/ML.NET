* Manufacturing company that uses industrial devices and equipment as part of its operations. When one of these devices breaks, it costs your company time and money. That's why performing maintenance on these devices is important.
* Scenario: Predictive maintenance
  1. There are many different factors, like usage, that affect the need for maintenance.
  2. No one device is the same.
  3. Being proactive with maintenance can help minimize the time and money that your company spends when a device breaks.
  4. Up to this point, you've been manually keeping track of which devices require maintenance.
  5. As your company expands, this process becomes more difficult to manage.
* What if you could automate predicting when a device is going to need maintenance by using sensor data?
  1. ML can help you analyze historical data from these sensors.
  2. ML can also involve learning patterns to help you predict whether a machine needs maintenance or not.
